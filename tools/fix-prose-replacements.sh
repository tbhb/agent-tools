# fix-prose-replacements — apply every vale finding that already carries
# its own correction, and leave the rest alone.
#
# Roughly a third of a typical run needs no judgment at all. Contractions
# wants "don't" for "do not", WordList wants "turn off" for "disable",
# OxfordComma wants a comma. The repo-local output template already
# prints the replacement as replace_with= on the finding line, because
# the rule's own action carries it. Reading those lines into a model and
# having it retype the answer costs tokens to reproduce a lookup.
#
# In the measured session behind this script, findings of this shape ran
# to about 40 of 111. Applying them here leaves the model the findings
# that need a decision.
#
# Safety comes from refusing to guess. Vale gives a line and a column
# span, and this checks that the span holds the exact text the finding
# quoted before touching it. A span that holds anything else means the
# file moved under the report, so that finding is skipped and named
# rather than applied. Findings on one line apply right to left, so an
# earlier replacement never shifts a later span.
#
# Rules that rewrite meaning stay out by construction: a finding with no
# replace_with is never touched, and that covers every distributional
# rule and every judgment call.
#
# Prints one line per applied change and one per skip. Silence means
# nothing carried a replacement.

# Google.Contractions pairs a pronoun with a form of "be" wherever the
# two sit next to each other, including across a clause boundary where
# the pronoun is really the object of the preceding preposition. Vale
# offers the contraction anyway, and taking it breaks the sentence:
# "a verdict from that is narrower" becomes "from that\x27s narrower",
# and "the cost of a fix for it is another round" becomes "for it\x27s
# another round". Both were live findings on this repository.
#
# So a pronoun contraction whose preceding word is a preposition gets
# reported rather than applied. A model reading the sentence settles it
# in one look, which is the whole division of labor here.
